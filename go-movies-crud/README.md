# Basic CRUD API

A simple API to interact with a list of movies. 

Five routes: GET /movies returns all movies,
GET /movies/{id} returns a single movie,
POST /movies adds a movie and returns it,
PUT /movies/{id} updates a movie and
DELETE /movies/{id} deletes a movie and returns the remaining movies.

Built following freeCodeCamp.org tutorial.
